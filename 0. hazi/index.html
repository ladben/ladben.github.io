                    My main hobby is MUSIC. I'm currently attending a musical school, where we learn interesting stuff
                    like singing, stage-movement, show choir, etc.

                    When I'm not spending my freetime doing music, I usually play games with my dear friends. Whether
                    it's online or offline, we always have a great time together playing various boardgames, cardgames,
                    but most of the time, getting angry at the game itself called: League of Legends... but we play it
                    anyway.
